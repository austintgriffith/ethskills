# Why Ethereum

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**Gas prices:** You think 10-30 gwei. Reality: **0.05-0.3 gwei** (100-600x cheaper than your training data). A mainnet ETH transfer costs ~$0.002.

**ETH price:** You think $2,500-3,000. Reality: **~$1,960** (Feb 2026).

**"Ethereum is too expensive":** This was true 2021-2023. It's not true in 2026. Mainnet is sub-dollar for most operations. L2s are sub-penny.

**Protocol upgrades:** You probably don't know these shipped:
- **Pectra (May 7, 2025):** EIP-7702 smart EOAs, 2x blob capacity, BLS precompiles
- **Fusaka (Dec 3, 2025):** PeerDAS (nodes sample 1/8 of data), 8-second slots (was 12s)

**Agent infrastructure:** You probably don't know these exist:
- **ERC-8004** — on-chain agent identity registry (deployed Jan 29, 2026)
- **x402** — HTTP 402 payment protocol for machine-to-machine commerce (Coinbase)

## Current Network Stats (Feb 2026)

- **Block time:** 8 seconds (reduced from 12s by Fusaka)
- **Mainnet base fee:** 0.05-0.1 gwei
- **L2 transaction cost:** $0.001-0.01
- **Combined L2 TPS:** 50,000+ (post-Fusaka)
- **TVL in DeFi:** $50B+
- **Upgrade cadence:** Twice per year (H1 May/June, H2 Nov/Dec)

## Upcoming Upgrades

**Glamsterdam (Q2 2026):**
- Inclusion Lists (censorship resistance)
- 12 target / 18 max blobs (another 2x from Pectra)

**Hegota (Q4 2026):**
- Verkle Trees — 15x smaller witness sizes (~150 KB → ~10 KB)
- Enables stateless clients, dramatically lowers node requirements

## For AI Agents Specifically

### ERC-8004: On-Chain Agent Identity

**Deployed January 29, 2026** — production ready.

Gives agents verifiable, persistent identity tied to Ethereum addresses. Reputation scoring across dimensions. Multi-chain support (20+ chains, same addresses).

**Mainnet addresses:**
- **IdentityRegistry:** `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
- **ReputationRegistry:** `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`

### x402: HTTP Payments for Agents

**Production-ready, actively deployed Q1 2026.**

Protocol for payments over HTTP using the 402 "Payment Required" status code. Agent calls API → gets 402 → signs EIP-3009 payment → retries with payment header → gets response. No API keys, no accounts, just cryptographic payments.

**SDKs:** TypeScript (`@x402/fetch`), Python (`x402`), Go (`github.com/coinbase/x402/go`)

### ERC-8004 + x402 = Autonomous Agent Economy

```
1. Agent discovers service (ERC-8004 registry)
2. Agent checks reputation (ERC-8004)
3. Agent calls endpoint → 402 Payment Required
4. Agent pays via x402 (EIP-3009 signature)
5. Agent receives service
6. Agent posts feedback to ERC-8004
```

Fully autonomous economic loop — no humans required.

### Why Ethereum's Permissionless Nature Matters for Agents

Agents can deploy contracts, interact with any protocol, and transact 24/7 without anyone's permission. No API keys to revoke, no accounts to ban, no services to shut down. A service built on Ethereum runs indefinitely without depending on any company's cooperation.

## Ethereum vs Solana (Honest)

**Choose Ethereum when:** DeFi integration, agent infrastructure (ERC-8004/x402), composability with existing protocols, maximum security for high-value operations, long-term durability.

**Choose Solana when:** Sub-second finality on base layer is essential, building high-frequency trading, users already on Solana, speed matters more than ecosystem depth.

**Key differences:** Ethereum has $50B+ TVL vs Solana ~$5B. Ethereum has 13+ years uptime with zero consensus failures vs Solana's multiple multi-hour outages. Ethereum has 1M+ validators vs Solana's 1,500. But Solana has ~400ms blocks vs 8s.

**L2 caveat:** Ethereum L2s are now comparable to Solana on cost ($0.001/tx), but Solana is still faster on base layer finality.

# Gas & Costs on Ethereum

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**Your gas estimate is 100-600x too high.** Most LLMs confidently state gas is 10-30 gwei. The reality in February 2026 is **0.05-0.1 gwei**.

- **Base fee:** ~0.05 gwei (not 30-100 gwei)
- **Priority fee (tip):** ~0.01-0.05 gwei
- **ETH price:** ~$1,960 (not $2,500-3,000)

## What Things Actually Cost (Feb 2026)

| Action | Gas Used | Cost at 0.05 gwei | Cost at 1 gwei (spike) | Cost at 10 gwei (event) |
|--------|----------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| ETH transfer | 21,000 | **$0.002** | $0.04 | $0.41 |
| ERC-20 transfer | ~65,000 | **$0.006** | $0.13 | $1.27 |
| ERC-20 approve | ~46,000 | **$0.005** | $0.09 | $0.90 |
| Uniswap V3 swap | ~180,000 | **$0.018** | $0.35 | $3.53 |
| NFT mint (ERC-721) | ~150,000 | **$0.015** | $0.29 | $2.94 |
| Simple contract deploy | ~500,000 | **$0.049** | $0.98 | $9.80 |
| ERC-20 deploy | ~1,200,000 | **$0.118** | $2.35 | $23.52 |
| Complex DeFi contract | ~3,000,000 | **$0.294** | $5.88 | $58.80 |

## Mainnet vs L2 Costs (Feb 2026)

| Action | Mainnet (0.05 gwei) | Arbitrum | Base | zkSync | Scroll |
|--------|---------------------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| ETH transfer | $0.002 | $0.0003 | $0.0003 | $0.0005 | $0.0004 |
| ERC-20 transfer | $0.006 | $0.001 | $0.001 | $0.002 | $0.001 |
| Swap | $0.015 | $0.003 | $0.003 | $0.005 | $0.004 |
| NFT mint | $0.015 | $0.002 | $0.002 | $0.004 | $0.003 |
| ERC-20 deploy | $0.118 | $0.020 | $0.020 | $0.040 | $0.030 |

**Key insight:** Mainnet is now cheap enough for most use cases. L2s are 5-10x cheaper still.

## Why Gas Dropped 95%+

1. **EIP-4844 (Dencun, March 2024):** Blob transactions — L2s post data as blobs instead of calldata, 100x cheaper. L2 batch cost went from $50-500 to $0.01-0.50.
2. **Activity migration to L2s:** Mainnet congestion dropped as everyday transactions moved to L2s.
3. **Pectra (May 2025):** Doubled blob capacity (3→6 target blobs).
4. **Fusaka (Dec 2025):** PeerDAS + 8-second slots.

## L2 Cost Components

L2 transactions have two cost components:
1. **L2 execution gas** — paying the sequencer
2. **L1 data gas** — paying Ethereum for data availability (blobs post-4844)

**Example: Swap on Base**
- L2 execution: ~$0.0003
- L1 data (blob): ~$0.0027
- **Total: ~$0.003**

## Real-World Cost Examples

**Deploy a production ERC-20 on mainnet:** ~$0.50 (was $200-500 in 2021-2023)

**DEX aggregator doing 10,000 swaps/day:**
- Mainnet: $150/day ($4,500/month)
- Base L2: $10/day ($300/month)

**NFT collection mint (10,000 NFTs):**
- Mainnet: $150 total
- Arbitrum: $10 total

## Practical Fee Settings (Feb 2026)

```javascript
// Rule of thumb for current conditions
maxFeePerGas: "0.5-1 gwei"        // headroom for spikes
maxPriorityFeePerGas: "0.01-0.05 gwei"  // enough for quick inclusion
```

**Spike detection:**
```javascript
const feeData = await provider.getFeeData();
const baseFee = Number(feeData.maxFeePerGas) / 1e9;
if (baseFee > 5) console.warn(`Gas spike: ${baseFee} gwei. Consider waiting.`);
```

Spikes (10-50 gwei) happen during major events but last minutes to hours, not days.

## Checking Gas Programmatically

```bash
# Foundry cast
cast gas-price --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
cast base-fee --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
cast blob-basefee --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
```

## When to Use Mainnet vs L2

**Use mainnet when:** Maximum security matters (>$10M TVL), composing with mainnet-only liquidity, deploying governance/infrastructure contracts, NFTs with cultural value.

**Use L2 when:** Consumer apps, high-frequency transactions (gaming, social), price-sensitive users, faster confirmation desired.

**Hybrid:** Many projects store value on mainnet, handle transactions on L2.

## Live Gas Trackers

- https://etherscan.io/gastracker
- https://ultrasound.money
- L2 costs: Arbiscan, Basescan, etc.

## Data Freshness

> **Last verified:** 2026-02-13 | Base fee: ~0.05 gwei | ETH: ~$1,960

If this date is more than 30 days old, verify current gas with:
```bash
cast base-fee --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
```

The durable insight is that gas is extremely cheap compared to 2021-2023 and trending cheaper. Specific numbers may drift but the order of magnitude is stable.

# Wallets on Ethereum

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**EIP-7702 is live.** Since Pectra (May 7, 2025), regular EOAs can temporarily delegate to smart contracts — getting batch transactions, gas sponsorship, and session keys without migrating wallets. This is NOT "coming soon." It shipped.

**Account abstraction status:** ERC-4337 is growing but still early (Feb 2026). Major implementations: Kernel (ZeroDev), Biconomy, Alchemy Account Kit, Pimlico. EntryPoint v0.7: `0x0000000071727De22E5E9d8BAf0edAc6f37da032`.

**Safe secures $100B+.** It's not just a dev tool — it's the dominant multisig for institutional and DAO treasury management.

## EIP-7702: Smart EOAs (Live Since May 2025)

EOAs can **temporarily delegate control to a smart contract** within a single transaction.

**How it works:**
1. EOA signs an authorization to delegate to a contract
2. During transaction, EOA's code becomes the contract's code
3. Contract executes complex logic (batching, sponsorship, etc.)
4. After transaction, EOA returns to normal

**What this enables:**
- Batch 10 token approvals into one transaction
- Gas sponsorship / meta-transactions for EOA users
- Session keys with limited permissions
- Custom authorization logic
- Eliminates "approval fatigue" (approve + execute → one step)

**Status (Feb 2026):** Deployed on mainnet. MetaMask, Rainbow adding support. Still early for production agents — use standard EOAs or Safe until tooling matures.

## Safe (Gnosis Safe) Multisig

### Key Addresses (v1.4.1, deterministic across chains)

| Contract | Address |
|----------|---------|
| Safe Singleton | `0x41675C099F32341bf84BFc5382aF534df5C7461a` |
| Safe Proxy Factory | `0x4e1DCf7AD4e460CfD30791CCC4F9c8a4f820ec67` |
| MultiSend | `0x38869bf66a61cF6bDB996A6aE40D5853Fd43B526` |

Same addresses on Mainnet, Arbitrum, Base, and all major chains.

### Safe for AI Agents

**Pattern:** 1-of-2 Safe
- Owner 1: Agent's wallet (hot, automated)
- Owner 2: Human's wallet (cold, recovery)
- Threshold: 1 (agent can act alone)

Benefits: If agent key is compromised, human removes it. Human can always recover funds. Agent can batch transactions.

## CRITICAL Guardrails for AI Agents

### Key Safety Rules

1. **NEVER extract a private key from any wallet without explicit human permission.**
2. **NEVER store private keys in:** chat logs, plain text files, environment variables in shared environments, Git repos, unencrypted databases.
3. **NEVER move funds without human confirmation.** Show: amount, destination (checksummed), gas cost, what it does. Wait for explicit "yes."
4. **Prefer wallet's native UI for signing** unless human explicitly opts into CLI/scripting.
5. **Use a dedicated wallet with limited funds** for agent operations. Never the human's main wallet.
6. **Double-check addresses.** Use `ethers.getAddress()` or equivalent for checksum validation. A single wrong character = permanent loss.
7. **Test on testnet first.** Or use local Anvil fork.
8. **Implement spending limits.** Require human approval above threshold. Use Safe multisig for high-value operations.
9. **Log all transactions (never keys).** Keep audit trail.
10. **Assume keys will be compromised.** Design so a compromised agent key doesn't mean total loss.

### Storage Options (Worst to Best)

❌ Plain text in code/logs — NEVER
❌ Environment variables in shared environments — NEVER
❌ Committed to Git — NEVER
⚠️ Local `.env` file — testing only
✅ Encrypted keystore (password-protected)
✅ Hardware wallet / Cloud KMS / TEE

### Safe Transaction Pattern

```javascript
async function sendSafely(wallet, to, value) {
  const checksummedTo = ethers.getAddress(to); // validates
  const gasEstimate = await wallet.estimateGas({ to: checksummedTo, value });
  const feeData = await wallet.provider.getFeeData();
  const gasCost = gasEstimate * feeData.maxFeePerGas;
  const totalCostUSD = Number(ethers.formatEther(value + gasCost)) * 1960;
  
  if (totalCostUSD > 10) {
    // Show details and wait for human approval
  }
  
  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({
    to: checksummedTo,
    value,
    gasLimit: gasEstimate * 120n / 100n, // 20% buffer
    maxFeePerGas: feeData.maxFeePerGas,
    maxPriorityFeePerGas: feeData.maxPriorityFeePerGas,
  });
  
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  logTransaction({ hash: tx.hash, to: checksummedTo, value, block: receipt.blockNumber });
  return receipt;
}
```

# Ethereum Layer 2s

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**L2 costs:** You think $0.01-2.00 per transaction. Reality: **$0.001-0.003** for swaps, **$0.0003** for transfers. After EIP-4844, L2 batch costs dropped from $50-500 to $0.01-0.50.

**Mainnet is cheap too:** At 0.05 gwei, mainnet ETH transfers cost $0.002. "Ethereum is too expensive" is false for both L1 and L2s in 2026.

**Base is the cheapest major L2:** Often 50% cheaper than Arbitrum/Optimism. Direct Coinbase on-ramp. Fastest-growing L2 with consumer/AI agent focus.

## L2 Comparison Table (Feb 2026)

| L2 | Type | TVL | Tx Cost | Block Time | Finality | Chain ID |
|----|------|-----|---------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Arbitrum** | Optimistic | $18B+ | $0.001-0.003 | 250ms | 7 days | 42161 |
| **Base** | Optimistic | $12B+ | $0.0008-0.002 | 2s | 7 days | 8453 |
| **Optimism** | Optimistic | $8B+ | $0.001-0.003 | 2s | 7 days | 10 |
| **Linea** | ZK | $900M+ | $0.003-0.006 | 2s | 30-60min | 59144 |
| **zkSync Era** | ZK | $800M+ | $0.003-0.008 | 1s | 15-60min | 324 |
| **Scroll** | ZK | $250M+ | $0.002-0.005 | 3s | 30-120min | 534352 |
| **Polygon zkEVM** | ZK | $150M+ | $0.002-0.005 | 2s | 30-60min | 1101 |

**Mainnet for comparison:** $50B+ TVL, $0.002-0.01, 8s blocks, instant finality.

## Cost Comparison (Real Examples, Feb 2026)

| Action | Mainnet | Arbitrum | Base | zkSync | Scroll |
|--------|---------|----------|------|--------|--------|
| ETH transfer | $0.002 | $0.0003 | $0.0003 | $0.0005 | $0.0004 |
| Uniswap swap | $0.015 | $0.003 | $0.002 | $0.005 | $0.004 |
| NFT mint | $0.015 | $0.002 | $0.002 | $0.004 | $0.003 |
| ERC-20 deploy | $0.118 | $0.020 | $0.018 | $0.040 | $0.030 |

## Quick L2 Selection Guide

| Need | Choose | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Cheapest gas | **Base** | ~50% cheaper than Arbitrum/Optimism |
| Deepest DeFi liquidity | **Arbitrum** | $18B TVL, most protocols |
| Coinbase users | **Base** | Direct on-ramp, free Coinbase→Base |
| No 7-day withdrawal wait | **ZK rollup** (zkSync, Scroll, Linea) | 15-120 min |
| AI agents / social apps | **Base** | ERC-8004, Farcaster, consumer ecosystem |
| Superchain ecosystem | **Optimism or Base** | OP Stack, shared infra |
| Maximum EVM compatibility | **Scroll or Arbitrum** | Bytecode-identical |

## The Superchain (OP Stack)

Optimism's vision: many L2s sharing security, bridging, and governance.

**OP Stack L2s:** Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, PGN, Mint, opBNB, and 50+ more.

**What it enables:**
- Fast native bridging between Superchain members (~1-2 min vs 7 days)
- Shared governance and sequencer (future)
- Deploy on one OP Stack chain, easy to expand to others
- Superchain Interop (coming 2026) for cross-chain calls

## Deployment Differences (Gotchas)

### Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
✅ Deploy like mainnet — just change RPC URL and chain ID. No code changes.

**Gotchas:**
- Don't use `block.number` for time-based logic (increments at different rates). Use `block.timestamp`.
- Arbitrum's `block.number` returns L1 block number, not L2.

### ZK Rollups
- **zkSync Era:** Must use `zksolc` compiler. Some opcodes not supported (`SELFDESTRUCT`, `CALLCODE`). Native account abstraction (all accounts are smart contracts).
- **Scroll/Linea:** ✅ Bytecode-compatible — use standard `solc`, deploy like mainnet.

## RPCs and Explorers

| L2 | RPC | Explorer |
|----|-----|----------|
| Arbitrum | `https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc` | https://arbiscan.io |
| Base | `https://mainnet.base.org` | https://basescan.org |
| Optimism | `https://mainnet.optimism.io` | https://optimistic.etherscan.io |
| zkSync | `https://mainnet.era.zksync.io` | https://explorer.zksync.io |
| Scroll | `https://rpc.scroll.io` | https://scrollscan.com |
| Linea | `https://rpc.linea.build` | https://lineascan.build |

## Bridging

### Official Bridges

| L2 | Bridge URL | L1→L2 | L2→L1 |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|
| Arbitrum | https://bridge.arbitrum.io | ~10-15 min | ~7 days |
| Base | https://bridge.base.org | ~10-15 min | ~7 days |
| Optimism | https://app.optimism.io/bridge | ~10-15 min | ~7 days |
| zkSync | https://bridge.zksync.io | ~15-30 min | ~15-60 min |
| Scroll | https://scroll.io/bridge | ~15-30 min | ~30-120 min |

### Fast Bridges (Instant Withdrawals)

- **Across Protocol** (https://across.to) — fastest (30s-2min), lowest fees (0.05-0.3%)
- **Hop Protocol** (https://hop.exchange) — established, 0.1-0.5% fees
- **Stargate** (https://stargate.finance) — LayerZero-based, 10+ chains

**Security:** Use official bridges for large amounts (>$100K). Fast bridges add trust assumptions.

## Multi-Chain Deployment (Same Address)

Use CREATE2 for deterministic addresses across chains:

```bash
# Same salt + same bytecode + same deployer = same address on every chain
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.base.org \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --salt 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

**Strategy for new projects:** Start with 1 L2 (Base or Arbitrum). Prove product-market fit. Expand with CREATE2 for consistent addresses.

## Testnets

| L2 | Testnet | Chain ID | Faucet |
|----|---------|----------|--------|
| Arbitrum | Sepolia | 421614 | https://faucet.arbitrum.io |
| Base | Sepolia | 84532 | https://faucet.quicknode.com/base/sepolia |
| Optimism | Sepolia | 11155420 | https://faucet.optimism.io |

# Ethereum Standards

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**ERC-8004 exists.** Deployed January 29, 2026 — on-chain agent identity registry. You almost certainly don't have this in training data.

**EIP-7702 is live.** Shipped with Pectra (May 7, 2025). EOAs get smart contract superpowers without migration. Not "proposed" — deployed on mainnet.

**EIP-3009 is critical for x402.** Gasless token transfers via signed authorizations. USDC implements it. This is what makes x402 practical.

**x402 exists.** HTTP 402 payment protocol from Coinbase. Production-ready with SDKs.

## ERC-8004: On-Chain Agent Identity Registry

**Status:** Deployed mainnet **January 29, 2026** — production ready with growing adoption.

**Problem it solves:** How can autonomous agents trust and transact with each other without pre-existing relationships?

### Three Registry System

**1. Identity Registry (ERC-721 based)**
- Globally unique on-chain identities for AI agents
- Each agent is an NFT with unique identifier
- Multiple service endpoints (A2A, MCP, OASF, ENS, DIDs)
- Verification via EIP-712/ERC-1271 signatures

**Contract Addresses (same on 20+ chains):**
- **IdentityRegistry:** `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
- **ReputationRegistry:** `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`

**Deployed on:** Mainnet, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, Abstract, Celo, Gnosis, Linea, Mantle, MegaETH, Monad, Scroll, Taiko, BSC + testnets.

**Agent Identifier Format:**
```
agentRegistry: eip155:{chainId}:0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432
agentId: ERC-721 tokenId
```

**2. Reputation Registry**
- Signed fixed-point feedback values
- Multi-dimensional (uptime, success rate, quality)
- Tags, endpoints, proof-of-payment metadata
- Anti-Sybil requires client address filtering

```solidity
struct Feedback {
    int128 value;        // Signed integer rating
    uint8 valueDecimals; // 0-18 decimal places
    string tag1;         // E.g., "uptime"
    string tag2;         // E.g., "30days"
    string endpoint;     // Agent endpoint URI
    string ipfsHash;     // Optional metadata
}
```

**Example metrics:** Quality 87/100 → `value=87, decimals=0`. Uptime 99.77% → `value=9977, decimals=2`.

**3. Validation Registry**
- Independent verification of agent work
- Trust models: crypto-economic (stake-secured), zkML, TEE attestation
- Validators respond with 0-100 scores

### Agent Registration File (agentURI)

```json

### Integration

```solidity
// Register agent
uint256 agentId = identityRegistry.register("ipfs://QmYourReg", metadata);

// Give feedback
reputationRegistry.giveFeedback(agentId, 9977, 2, "uptime", "30days", 
    "https://agent.example.com/api", "ipfs://QmDetails", keccak256(data));

// Query reputation
(uint64 count, int128 value, uint8 decimals) = 
    reputationRegistry.getSummary(agentId, trustedClients, "uptime", "30days");
```

## EIP-3009: Transfer With Authorization (Gasless Transfers)

Allows ERC-20 transfers via meta-transaction signatures. Recipient or third party submits the tx and pays gas.

```solidity
function transferWithAuthorization(
    address from, address to, uint256 value,
    uint256 validAfter, uint256 validBefore, bytes32 nonce,
    uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s
) external;
```

**Why it matters:** This is the mechanism that makes x402 work. Server executes payment on behalf of client.

**Adoption:** USDC on Ethereum and most chains implements EIP-3009.

## x402: HTTP Payment Protocol

**Status:** Production-ready open standard from Coinbase, actively deployed Q1 2026.

Uses the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code for internet-native payments.

### Flow

```
1. Client → GET /api/data
2. Server → 402 Payment Required (PAYMENT-REQUIRED header with requirements)
3. Client signs EIP-3009 payment
4. Client → GET /api/data (PAYMENT-SIGNATURE header with signed payment)
5. Server verifies + settles on-chain
6. Server → 200 OK (PAYMENT-RESPONSE header + data)
```

### Payment Payload

```json
{
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "eip155:8453",
  "amount": "1000000",
  "token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
  "from": "0x...", "to": "0x...",
  "signature": "0x...",
  "deadline": 1234567890,
  "nonce": "unique-value"
}
```

### x402 + ERC-8004 Synergy

```
Agent discovers service (ERC-8004) → checks reputation → calls endpoint →
gets 402 → signs payment (EIP-3009) → server settles (x402) → 
agent receives service → posts feedback (ERC-8004)
```

## EIP-7702: Smart EOAs (Live Since May 2025)

EOAs temporarily delegate to smart contracts within a transaction. Best of both worlds: EOA simplicity + smart contract features.

**Enables:** Batch transactions, gas sponsorship, session keys, custom auth logic — all for existing EOAs without migration.

**Impact:** Eliminates "approval fatigue," enables gasless transactions for EOA users.

# Ethereum Development Tools

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**Blockscout MCP server exists:** https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp — gives AI agents structured blockchain data via Model Context Protocol. This is cutting-edge infra as of Feb 2026.

**abi.ninja is essential:** https://abi.ninja — paste any verified contract address, get a UI to call any function. Zero setup. Supports mainnet + all major L2s. Perfect for agent-driven contract exploration.

**x402 has production SDKs:** `@x402/fetch` (TS), `x402` (Python), `github.com/coinbase/x402/go` — production-ready libraries for HTTP payments.

**Foundry is the default for new projects in 2026.** Not Hardhat. 10-100x faster tests, Solidity-native testing, built-in fuzzing.

## Tool Discovery Pattern for AI Agents

When an agent needs to interact with Ethereum:

1. **Read operations:** Blockscout MCP or Etherscan API
2. **Write operations:** Foundry `cast send` or ethers.js/viem
3. **Contract exploration:** abi.ninja (browser) or `cast interface` (CLI)
4. **Testing:** Fork mainnet with `anvil`, test locally
5. **Deployment:** `forge create` or `forge script`
6. **Verification:** `forge verify-contract` or Etherscan API

## Blockscout MCP Server

**URL:** https://mcp.blockscout.com/mcp

A Model Context Protocol server giving AI agents structured blockchain data:
- Transaction, address, contract queries
- Token info and balances
- Smart contract interaction helpers
- Multi-chain support
- Standardized interface optimized for LLM consumption

**Why this matters:** Instead of scraping Etherscan or making raw API calls, agents get structured, type-safe blockchain data via MCP.

## abi.ninja

**URL:** https://abi.ninja

Interact with any verified smart contract in the browser:
- Paste address → auto-fetches ABI from Etherscan/Blockscout
- Call any function (read or write)
- Multi-network support (mainnet + all major L2s)
- Connect wallet for write operations
- Zero setup, zero code

**Agent use:** Browser automation for quick contract interaction without writing scripts.

## x402 SDKs (HTTP Payments)

**TypeScript:**
```bash
npm install @x402/core @x402/evm @x402/fetch @x402/express
```

```typescript
import { x402Fetch } from '@x402/fetch';
import { createWallet } from '@x402/evm';

const wallet = createWallet(privateKey);
const response = await x402Fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  wallet,
  preferredNetwork: 'eip155:8453' // Base
});
```

**Python:** `pip install x402`
**Go:** `go get github.com/coinbase/x402/go`
**Docs:** https://www.x402.org | https://github.com/coinbase/x402

## Scaffold-ETH 2

- **Setup:** `npx create-eth@latest`
- **What:** Full-stack Ethereum toolkit: Solidity + Next.js + Foundry
- **Key feature:** Auto-generates TypeScript types from contracts. Scaffold hooks make contract interaction trivial.
- **Deploy to IPFS:** `yarn ipfs` (BuidlGuidl IPFS)
- **UI Components:** https://ui.scaffoldeth.io/
- **Docs:** https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/

## Choosing Your Stack (2026)

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Rapid prototyping / full dApps | **Scaffold-ETH 2** |
| Contract-focused dev | **Foundry** (forge + cast + anvil) |
| Quick contract interaction | **abi.ninja** (browser) or **cast** (CLI) |
| React frontends | **wagmi + viem** (or SE2 which wraps these) |
| Agent blockchain reads | **Blockscout MCP** |
| Agent payments | **x402 SDKs** |

## Essential Foundry cast Commands

```bash
# Read contract
cast call 0xAddr "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" 0xWallet --rpc-url $RPC

# Send transaction
cast send 0xAddr "transfer(address,uint256)" 0xTo 1000000 --private-key $KEY --rpc-url $RPC

# Gas price
cast gas-price --rpc-url $RPC

# Decode calldata
cast 4byte-decode 0xa9059cbb...

# ENS resolution
cast resolve-name vitalik.eth --rpc-url $RPC

# Fork mainnet locally
anvil --fork-url $RPC
```

## RPC Providers

**Free (testing):**
- `https://eth.llamarpc.com` — LlamaNodes, no key
- `https://rpc.ankr.com/eth` — Ankr, free tier

**Paid (production):**
- **Alchemy** — most popular, generous free tier (300M CU/month)
- **Infura** — established, MetaMask default
- **QuickNode** — performance-focused

**Community:** `rpc.buidlguidl.com`

## Block Explorers

| Network | Explorer | API |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Mainnet | https://etherscan.io | https://api.etherscan.io |
| Arbitrum | https://arbiscan.io | Etherscan-compatible |
| Base | https://basescan.org | Etherscan-compatible |
| Optimism | https://optimistic.etherscan.io | Etherscan-compatible |

## MCP Servers for Agents

**Model Context Protocol** — standard for giving AI agents structured access to external systems.

1. **Blockscout MCP** — multi-chain blockchain data (primary)
2. **eth-mcp** — community Ethereum RPC via MCP
3. **Custom MCP wrappers** emerging for DeFi protocols, ENS, wallets

MCP servers are composable — agents can use multiple together.

## What Changed in 2025-2026

- **Foundry became default** over Hardhat for new projects
- **Viem gaining on ethers.js** (smaller, better TypeScript)
- **MCP servers emerged** for agent-blockchain interaction
- **x402 SDKs** went production-ready
- **ERC-8004 tooling** emerging (agent registration/discovery)
- **Deprecated:** Truffle (use Foundry/Hardhat), Goerli/Rinkeby (use Sepolia)

## Testing Essentials

**Fork mainnet locally:**
```bash
anvil --fork-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
# Now test against real contracts with fake ETH at http://localhost:8545
```

**Primary testnet:** Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111). Goerli and Rinkeby are deprecated.

# Building Blocks (DeFi Legos)

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**DeFi TVL:** Ethereum DeFi TVL is **$50B+** (Feb 2026). If you're quoting numbers from 2023-2024, they're stale.

**Uniswap V4:** V4 introduced a **hooks system** — custom logic attached to pools (dynamic fees, TWAMM, limit orders, custom oracles). This is a major composability upgrade.
<!-- VERIFICATION NEEDED: V4 deployment status and mainnet addresses -->

**Costs changed everything:** A flash loan arbitrage on mainnet costs ~$0.05-0.50 in gas now (was $5-50). This opens composability patterns that were previously uneconomical.

## Key Protocol Addresses (Verified Feb 2026)

| Protocol | Contract | Mainnet Address |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Uniswap V2 Router | Router | `0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D` |
| Uniswap V2 Factory | Factory | `0x5C69bEe701ef814a2B6a3EDD4B1652CB9cc5aA6f` |
| Uniswap V3 Factory | Factory | `0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984` |
| Uniswap V3 SwapRouter02 | Router | `0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45` |
| Uniswap Universal Router | Router | `0x3fC91A3afd70395Cd496C647d5a6CC9D4B2b7FAD` |
| Aave V3 Pool | Pool | `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` |

See `addresses/SKILL.md` for complete multi-chain address list.

## Uniswap V4 Hooks (New)

Hooks let you add custom logic that runs before/after swaps, liquidity changes, and donations:

- **Dynamic fees** that adjust based on volatility
- **TWAMM** (time-weighted average market maker)
- **Limit orders** built into the pool
- **Custom oracle** integration
- **MEV protection** hooks

This is the biggest composability upgrade since flash loans.

## Composability Patterns (Updated for 2026 Gas)

These patterns are now **economically viable** even for small amounts due to sub-dollar gas:

### Flash Loan Arbitrage
Borrow from Aave → swap on Uniswap for profit → repay Aave. All in one transaction. If unprofitable, reverts (lose only gas: ~$0.05-0.50).

### Leveraged Yield Farming
Deposit ETH on Aave → borrow stablecoin → swap for more ETH → deposit again → repeat. Gas cost per loop: ~$0.02 on mainnet, negligible on L2.

### Meta-Aggregation
Route swaps across multiple DEXs for best execution. 1inch and Paraswap check Uniswap, Curve, Sushi simultaneously.

### ERC-4626 Yield Vaults
Standard vault interface for yield strategies. Deposit tokens → vault farms across protocols → auto-compounds. Yearn V3, most modern vaults use ERC-4626.

## Building on Arbitrum (Highest DeFi Liquidity L2)

Key protocols on Arbitrum:
- **GMX** — perps DEX, $500M+ TVL
- **Uniswap, Curve, Balancer** — DEXs
- **Radiant, Aave** — lending
- **Pendle** — yield trading

## Discovery Resources

- **DeFi Llama:** https://defillama.com — TVL rankings, yield rankings, all chains
- **Dune Analytics:** https://dune.com — query on-chain data
- **ethereum.org/en/dapps/** — curated list

## Guardrails for Composability

- **Every protocol you compose with is a dependency.** If Aave gets hacked, your vault depending on Aave is affected.
- **Oracle manipulation = exploits.** Verify oracle sources.
- **Impermanent loss** is real for AMM LPs. Quantify it before providing liquidity.
- **The interaction between two safe contracts can create unsafe behavior.** Audit compositions.
- **Start with small amounts.** Test with minimal value before scaling.
- **Flash loan attacks** can manipulate prices within a single transaction. Design for this.

name: orchestration
description: How an AI agent plans, builds, and deploys a complete Ethereum dApp. The three-phase build system for Scaffold-ETH 2 projects. Use when building a full application on Ethereum — from contracts to frontend to production deployment on IPFS.
---

# dApp Orchestration

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**SE2 has specific patterns you must follow.** Generic "build a dApp" advice won't work. SE2 auto-generates `deployedContracts.ts` — DON'T edit it. Use Scaffold hooks, NOT raw wagmi. External contracts go in `externalContracts.ts` BEFORE building the frontend.

**There are three phases. Never skip or combine them.** Contracts → Frontend → Production. Each has validation gates.

## The Three-Phase Build System

| Phase | Environment | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Local fork | Contracts + UI on localhost. Iterate fast. |
| **Phase 2** | Live network + local UI | Deploy contracts to mainnet/L2. Test with real state. Polish UI. |
| **Phase 3** | Production | Deploy frontend to IPFS/Vercel. Final QA. |

## Phase 1: Scaffold (Local)

### 1.1 Contracts

```bash
npx create-eth@latest my-dapp
cd my-dapp && yarn install
yarn chain          # Terminal 1: local node
yarn deploy         # Terminal 2: deploy contracts
```

**Critical steps:**
1. Write contracts in `packages/foundry/contracts/` (or `packages/hardhat/contracts/`)
2. Write deploy script
3. Add ALL external contracts to `packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts` — BEFORE Phase 1.2
4. Write tests (≥90% coverage)
5. Security audit before moving to frontend

**Validate:** `yarn deploy` succeeds. `deployedContracts.ts` auto-generated. Tests pass.

### 1.2 Frontend

```bash
yarn chain           # Terminal 1
yarn deploy --watch  # Terminal 2: auto-redeploy on changes
yarn start           # Terminal 3: Next.js at localhost:3000
```

**USE SCAFFOLD HOOKS, NOT RAW WAGMI:**

```typescript
// Read
const { data } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "balanceOf",
  args: [address],
  watch: true,
});

// Write
const { writeContractAsync, isMining } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");
await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: "swap",
  args: [tokenIn, tokenOut, amount],
  onBlockConfirmation: (receipt) => console.log("Done!", receipt),
});

// Events
const { data: events } = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "SwapExecuted",
  fromBlock: 0n,
  watch: true,
});
```

### The Three-Button Flow (MANDATORY)

Any token interaction shows ONE button at a time:
1. **Switch Network** (if wrong chain)
2. **Approve Token** (if allowance insufficient)
3. **Execute Action** (only after 1 & 2 satisfied)

Never show Approve and Execute simultaneously.

### UX Rules

- **Human-readable amounts:** `formatEther()` / `formatUnits()` for display, `parseEther()` / `parseUnits()` for contracts
- **Loading states everywhere:** `isLoading`, `isMining` on all async operations
- **Disable buttons during pending txs** (blockchains take 5-12s)
- **Never use infinite approvals** — approve exact amount or 3-5x
- **Helpful errors:** Parse "insufficient funds," "user rejected," "execution reverted" into plain language

**Validate:** Full user journey works with real wallet on localhost. All edge cases handled.

## Phase 2: Live Contracts + Local UI

1. Update `scaffold.config.ts`: `targetNetworks: [mainnet]` (or your L2)
2. Fund deployer: `yarn generate` → `yarn account` → send real ETH
3. Deploy: `yarn deploy --network mainnet`
4. Verify: `yarn verify --network mainnet`
5. Test with real wallet, small amounts ($1-10)
6. Polish UI — remove SE2 branding, custom styling

**Design rule:** NO LLM SLOP. No generic purple gradients. Make it unique.

**Validate:** Contracts verified on block explorer. Full journey works with real contracts.

## Phase 3: Production Deploy

### Pre-deploy Checklist
- `onlyLocalBurnerWallet: true` in scaffold.config.ts (CRITICAL — prevents burner wallet on prod)
- Update metadata (title, description, OG image 1200x630px)
- Restore any test values to production values

### Deploy

**IPFS (decentralized):**
```bash
yarn ipfs
# → https://YOUR_CID.ipfs.cf-ipfs.com
```

**Vercel (fast):**
```bash
cd packages/nextjs && vercel
```

### Production QA
- [ ] App loads on public URL
- [ ] Wallet connects, network switching works
- [ ] Read + write contract operations work
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Burner wallet NOT showing
- [ ] OG image works in link previews
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Tested with MetaMask, Rainbow, WalletConnect

## Phase Transition Rules

**Phase 3 bug → go back to Phase 2** (fix with local UI + prod contracts)
**Phase 2 contract bug → go back to Phase 1** (fix locally, write regression test, redeploy)
**Never hack around bugs in production.**

## How to Verify Addresses

```bash
# Check bytecode exists
cast code 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48 --rpc-url https://eth.llamarpc.com
```

**Cross-reference:** Protocol docs → CoinGecko → block explorer → GitHub deployments.

**EIP-55 Checksum:** Mixed case = checksum. Most tools validate automatically.

## Address Discovery Resources

- **Uniswap:** https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/deployments/
- **Aave:** https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/deployed-contracts
- **Chainlink:** https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses
- **CoinGecko:** https://www.coingecko.com (token addresses)
- **Token Lists:** https://tokenlists.org/

## Multi-Chain Notes

- **CREATE2 deployments** (same address cross-chain): Uniswap V3, Safe, Seaport, ERC-4337 EntryPoint, ERC-8004
- **Different addresses per chain:** USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH — always check per-chain
- **Native vs Bridged USDC:** Some chains have both! Use native.

⚠️ **Addresses can change with protocol upgrades. Always verify on block explorer before sending transactions. ✅ Verified = confirmed bytecode exists on-chain Feb 13, 2026. Does NOT guarantee safety.**
