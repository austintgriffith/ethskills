# Ship a dApp

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**You jump to code without a plan.** Before writing a single line of Solidity, you need to know: what goes onchain, what stays offchain, which chain, how many contracts, and who calls every function. Skip this and you'll rewrite everything.

**You over-engineer.** Most dApps need 0-2 contracts. A token launch is 1 contract. An NFT collection is 1 contract. A marketplace that uses existing DEX liquidity needs 0 contracts. Three contracts is the upper bound for an MVP. If you're writing more, you're building too much.

**You put too much onchain.** Solidity is for ownership, transfers, and commitments. It's not a database. It's not an API. It's not a backend. If it doesn't involve trustless value transfer or a permanent commitment, it doesn't belong in a smart contract.

**You skip chain selection.** The 2026 answer is almost always an L2. Base for consumer apps. Arbitrum for DeFi. Optimism for public goods. Mainnet only if you need maximum security or composability with mainnet-only protocols. Fetch `l2s/SKILL.md` for the full decision matrix.

**You forget nothing is automatic.** Smart contracts don't run themselves. Every state transition needs a caller who pays gas and a reason to do it. If you can't answer "who calls this and why?" for every function, your contract has dead code. Fetch `concepts/SKILL.md` for the full mental model.

## Phase 0 — Plan the Architecture

Do this BEFORE writing any code. Every hour spent here saves ten hours of rewrites.

### The Onchain Litmus Test

Put it onchain if it involves:
- **Trustless ownership** — who owns this token/NFT/position?
- **Trustless exchange** — swapping, trading, lending, borrowing
- **Composability** — other contracts need to call it
- **Censorship resistance** — must work even if your team disappears
- **Permanent commitments** — votes, attestations, proofs

Keep it offchain if it involves:
- User profiles, preferences, settings
- Search, filtering, sorting
- Images, videos, metadata (store on IPFS, reference onchain)
- Business logic that changes frequently
- Anything that doesn't involve value transfer or trust

**Judgment calls:**
- Reputation scores → offchain compute, onchain commitments (hashes or attestations)
- Activity feeds → offchain indexing of onchain events (fetch `indexing/SKILL.md`)
- Price data → offchain oracles writing onchain (Chainlink)
- Game state → depends on stakes. Poker with real money? Onchain. Leaderboard? Offchain.

### MVP Contract Count

| What you're building | Contracts | Pattern |
|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| Token launch | 1 | ERC-20 with custom logic |
| NFT collection | 1 | ERC-721 with mint/metadata |
| Simple marketplace | 0-1 | Use existing DEX; maybe a listing contract |
| Vault / yield | 1 | ERC-4626 vault |
| Lending protocol | 1-2 | Pool + oracle integration |
| DAO / governance | 1-3 | Governor + token + timelock |
| AI agent service | 0-1 | Maybe an ERC-8004 registration |
| Prediction market | 1-2 | Market + resolution oracle |

**If you need more than 3 contracts for an MVP, you're over-building.** Ship the simplest version that works, then iterate.

### State Transition Audit

For EVERY function in your contract, fill in this worksheet:

```
Function: ____________
Who calls it? ____________
Why would they? ____________
What if nobody calls it? ____________
Does it need gas incentives? ____________
```

If "what if nobody calls it?" breaks your system, you have a design problem. Fix it before writing code. See `concepts/SKILL.md` for incentive design patterns.

### Chain Selection (Quick Version)

| Priority | Chain | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Consumer app, low fees | **Base** | Cheapest L2, Coinbase distribution, strong ecosystem |
| DeFi, complex protocols | **Arbitrum** | Deepest DeFi liquidity on any L2, mature tooling |
| Public goods, governance | **Optimism** | Retroactive public goods funding, OP Stack ecosystem |
| Maximum security | **Ethereum mainnet** | Only if you need mainnet composability or $100M+ TVL |
| Privacy features | **zkSync / Scroll** | ZK rollups with potential privacy extensions |

## dApp Archetype Templates

Find your archetype below. Each tells you exactly how many contracts you need, what they do, common mistakes, and which skills to fetch.

### 1. Token Launch (1-2 contracts)

**Architecture:** One ERC-20 contract. Add a vesting contract if you have team/investor allocations.

**Contracts:**
- `MyToken.sol` — ERC-20 with initial supply, maybe mint/burn
- `TokenVesting.sol` (optional) — time-locked releases for team tokens

**Common mistakes:**
- Infinite supply with no burn mechanism (what gives it value?)
- No initial liquidity plan (deploying a token nobody can buy)
- Fee-on-transfer mechanics that break DEX integrations

**Fetch sequence:** `standards/SKILL.md` → `security/SKILL.md` → `testing/SKILL.md` → `gas/SKILL.md`

### 2. NFT Collection (1 contract)

**Architecture:** One ERC-721 contract. Metadata on IPFS. Frontend for minting.

**Contracts:**
- `MyNFT.sol` — ERC-721 with mint, max supply, metadata URI

**Common mistakes:**
- Storing images onchain (use IPFS or Arweave, store the hash onchain)
- No max supply cap (unlimited minting destroys value)
- Complex whitelist logic when a simple Merkle root works

**Fetch sequence:** `standards/SKILL.md` → `security/SKILL.md` → `testing/SKILL.md` → `frontend-ux/SKILL.md`

### 3. Marketplace / Exchange (0-2 contracts)

**Architecture:** If trading existing tokens, you likely need 0 contracts — integrate with Uniswap/Aerodrome. If building custom order matching, 1-2 contracts.

**Contracts:**
- (often none — use existing DEX liquidity via router)
- `OrderBook.sol` (if custom) — listing, matching, settlement
- `Escrow.sol` (if needed) — holds assets during trades

**Common mistakes:**
- Building a DEX from scratch when Uniswap V4 hooks can do it
- Ignoring MEV (fetch `security/SKILL.md` for sandwich attack protection)
- Centralized order matching (defeats the purpose)

**Fetch sequence:** `building-blocks/SKILL.md` → `addresses/SKILL.md` → `security/SKILL.md` → `testing/SKILL.md`

### 4. Lending / Vault / Yield (0-1 contracts)

**Architecture:** If using existing protocol (Aave, Compound), 0 contracts — just integrate. If building a vault, 1 ERC-4626 contract.

**Contracts:**
- `MyVault.sol` — ERC-4626 vault wrapping a yield source

**Common mistakes:**
- Ignoring vault inflation attack (fetch `security/SKILL.md`)
- Not using ERC-4626 standard (breaks composability)
- Hardcoding token decimals (USDC is 6, not 18)

**Fetch sequence:** `building-blocks/SKILL.md` → `standards/SKILL.md` → `security/SKILL.md` → `testing/SKILL.md`

### 5. DAO / Governance (1-3 contracts)

**Architecture:** Governor contract + governance token + timelock. Use OpenZeppelin's Governor — don't build from scratch.

**Contracts:**
- `GovernanceToken.sol` — ERC-20Votes
- `MyGovernor.sol` — OpenZeppelin Governor with voting parameters
- `TimelockController.sol` — delays execution for safety

**Common mistakes:**
- No timelock (governance decisions execute instantly = rug vector)
- Low quorum that allows minority takeover
- Token distribution so concentrated that one whale controls everything

**Fetch sequence:** `standards/SKILL.md` → `building-blocks/SKILL.md` → `security/SKILL.md` → `testing/SKILL.md`

### 6. AI Agent Service (0-1 contracts)

**Architecture:** Agent logic is offchain. Onchain component is optional — ERC-8004 identity registration, or a payment contract for x402.

**Contracts:**
- (often none — agent runs offchain, uses existing payment infra)
- `AgentRegistry.sol` (optional) — ERC-8004 identity + service endpoints

**Common mistakes:**
- Putting agent logic onchain (Solidity is not for AI inference)
- Overcomplicating payments (x402 handles HTTP-native payments)
- Ignoring key management (fetch `wallets/SKILL.md`)

**Fetch sequence:** `standards/SKILL.md` → `wallets/SKILL.md` → `tools/SKILL.md` → `orchestration/SKILL.md`

---

## Phase 1 — Build Contracts

**Fetch:** `standards/SKILL.md`, `building-blocks/SKILL.md`, `addresses/SKILL.md`, `security/SKILL.md`

Key guidance:
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts as your base — don't reinvent ERC-20, ERC-721, or AccessControl
- Use verified addresses from `addresses/SKILL.md` for any protocol integration — never fabricate addresses
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern for every external call
- Emit events for every state change (your frontend and indexer need them)
- Use `SafeERC20` for all token operations
- Run through the security checklist in `security/SKILL.md` before moving to Phase 2

For SE2 projects, follow `orchestration/SKILL.md` Phase 1 for the exact build sequence.

---

## Phase 2 — Test

**Fetch:** `testing/SKILL.md`

Don't skip this. Don't "test later." Test before deploy.

Key guidance:
- Unit test every custom function (not OpenZeppelin internals)
- Fuzz test all math operations — fuzzing finds the bugs you didn't think of
- Fork test any integration with external protocols (Uniswap, Aave, etc.)
- Run `slither .` for static analysis before deploying
- Target edge cases: zero amounts, max uint, empty arrays, self-transfers, unauthorized callers

---

## Phase 3 — Build Frontend

**Fetch:** `orchestration/SKILL.md`, `frontend-ux/SKILL.md`, `tools/SKILL.md`

Key guidance:
- Use Scaffold-ETH 2 hooks, not raw wagmi — `useScaffoldReadContract`, `useScaffoldWriteContract`
- Implement the three-button flow: Switch Network → Approve → Execute
- Show loading states on every async operation (blockchains take 5-12 seconds)
- Display token amounts in human-readable form with `formatEther`/`formatUnits`
- Never use infinite approvals

---

## Phase 4 — Ship to Production

**Fetch:** `wallets/SKILL.md`, `frontend-playbook/SKILL.md`, `gas/SKILL.md`

### Contract Deployment
1. Set gas settings appropriate for the target chain (fetch `gas/SKILL.md`)
2. Deploy and verify contracts on block explorer
3. Transfer ownership to a multisig (Gnosis Safe) — never leave a single EOA as owner in production
4. Post-deploy checks: call every read function, verify state, test one small transaction

### Frontend Deployment
Fetch `frontend-playbook/SKILL.md` for the full pipeline:
- **IPFS** — decentralized, censorship-resistant, permanent
- **Vercel** — fast, easy, but centralized
- **ENS subdomain** — human-readable URL pointing to IPFS

### Post-Launch
- Set up event monitoring with The Graph or Dune (fetch `indexing/SKILL.md`)
- Monitor contract activity on block explorer
- Have an incident response plan (pause mechanism if applicable, communication channel)

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Kitchen sink contract.** One contract doing everything — swap, lend, stake, govern. Split responsibilities. Each contract should do one thing well.

**Factory nobody asked for.** Building a factory contract that deploys new contracts when you only need one instance. Factories are for protocols that serve many users creating their own instances (like Uniswap creating pools). Most dApps don't need them.

**Onchain everything.** Storing user profiles, activity logs, images, or computed analytics in a smart contract. Use onchain for ownership and value transfer, offchain for everything else.

**Admin crutch.** Relying on an admin account to call maintenance functions. What happens when the admin loses their key? Design permissionless alternatives with proper incentives.

**Premature multi-chain.** Deploying to 5 chains on day one. Launch on one chain, prove product-market fit, then expand. Multi-chain adds complexity in bridging, state sync, and liquidity fragmentation.

**Reinventing audited primitives.** Writing your own ERC-20, your own access control, your own math library. Use OpenZeppelin. They're audited, battle-tested, and free. Your custom version has bugs.

**Ignoring the frontend.** A working contract with a broken UI is useless. Most users interact through the frontend, not Etherscan. Budget 40% of your time for frontend polish.

## Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] Identify what goes onchain vs offchain (use the Litmus Test above)
- [ ] Count your contracts (aim for 1-2 for MVP)
- [ ] Pick your chain (Base, Arbitrum, or Optimism for most apps)
- [ ] Audit every state transition (who calls it? why?)
- [ ] Write contracts using OpenZeppelin base contracts
- [ ] Test with Foundry (unit + fuzz + fork tests)
- [ ] Deploy, verify, transfer ownership to multisig
- [ ] Ship frontend (IPFS or Vercel), run production QA
